# SSTF-DISC-SCHEDULING
The objective of the SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) disk scheduling project is to implement a disk scheduling algorithm that minimizes the seek time and maximizes the disk's overall performance. The SSTF algorithm selects the next request that is closest to the current head position, reducing the seek time required to access data.
